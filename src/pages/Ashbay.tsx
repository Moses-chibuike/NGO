                                    The turning point came with a profound personal lossâ€”the mysterious death of his best friend,

                                    Oluseyi IfeanyiChukwu Alao's journey began with a bold leapâ€”a solo 
                                    migration to New York City eight years ago. Raised by his grandparents after losing both parents at a young age, Oluseyi 
                                    had already learned the weight of responsibility, but nothing could prepare him for the immense 
                                    challenges of adjusting to life in a new country. Between juggling long hours at multiple jobs, 
                                    finishing business school, and providing financial support for his son, grandmother, and 
                                    extended family back home, his resilience was constantly tested.
